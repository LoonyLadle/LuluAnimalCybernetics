# Lulu's Animal Cybernetics
Allows installing of all cybernetics on animals.

## There's a lot of animal cybernetics mods; what makes this one different?
Lulu's Animal Cybernetics allows the installation of _all_ cybernetics on animals with _existing_ recipes; absolutely no new defs are added! This means it is (theoretically) completely safe to add or remove from a game in progress, guaranteed to match core balance, and inherently compatible with most animal and prosthetic mods.

## Compatibility
Mods that adds animals with new body parts will require a compatibility patch to allow the existing recipes to target the new parts. Mods that add cybernetics that do not benefit animals will nonetheless have their cybernetics made available to animals. These incompatibilities can be fixed with a simple patch file; modders should consult this mod's own patch file to see how it was done.
